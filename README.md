# AoE4-random-civ

Age of empires 4 doesn't have a random button. This program draws a random civ from the list for you. 

If you don't want to pick from all the civilizations you can exclude some using the --exclude flag, passing the first letters of the civs you don't want. You can also select the ones you do want using --include.

## Todo
* automatically update list of civilizations in case more are added
* make available as a web app
